Spark In Action

The goal of regression \( or any other machine learning algorithm\) is to find, based on a set of examples, a mathematical function that is as close an approximation of the relationship between features and the target variable as possible. The regression in figure 7.3 is a simple linear regression because there is only one independent variable \(making it simple\), and the hypothesis function is modeled as a linear function \(a straight line\). If there were two variables, you could plot the estimation function in 3D space as a plane. **When there are more features, the function becomes a hyperplane.**
