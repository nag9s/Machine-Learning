Spark The Definitive Guide

Hyperparameters are initialization configurations for models. They are parameters that influence other parameters.

 Hyperparameters are set prior to the actual algorithmic training process and determine how the model’s parameters should behave during training. For instance, Logistic Regression has a hyperparameter that determines how much regularization should be performed on our data through the training phase. You’ll see in the next couple of pages that we can setup our pipeline to try different hyperparameter values \(e.g., different regularization values\) in order to compare different variations of the same model against one another.
