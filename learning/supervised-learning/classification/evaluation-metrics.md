##### _Machine Learing with Saprk 2nd Edition_



When we make predictions using our model, as we did earlier, how do we know whether the predictions

are good or not? We need to be able to evaluate how well our model performs. Evaluation metrics

commonly used in binary classification include prediction accuracy and error, precision and recall, the

area under the precision-recall curve, the receiver operating characteristic \(ROC\) curve, the area under

ROC curve \(AUC\), and the F-measure.
