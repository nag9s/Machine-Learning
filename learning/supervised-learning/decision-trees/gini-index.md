# Gini index for impurity check

Gini index is the cost function used to evaluate splits \(nodes\) in the dataset. Whenever we use the word **split**, it belongs to the node, so each split has two important aspects; the first is attribute and the second is attribute value, which will divide our data into two groups.

Gini score can be used to know the impurity of our dataset just like the information gain of the attribute. But here, it works a bit differently; Gini score suggests how well the dataset can be separated. Let's understand this with an example.
