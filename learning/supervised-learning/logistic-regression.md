 This is the problem in which **outcomes are discrete classes rather than continuous values.** For example, **a customer will arrive or not, he will purchase the product or not, and so on.** In statistical methodology, it uses the maximum likelihood method to calculate the parameter of individual variables. In contrast, in machine learning methodology, log loss will be minimized with respect to  _Î² _ coefficients \(also known as weights\).** Logistic regression has a high bias and a low variance error.**
