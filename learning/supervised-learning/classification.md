Spark In Action



a classification problem because target variables are categorical \(or qualitative\), which means they can take on a limited number of values \(discrete values\) \( Same as Logistic Regression \) In classification algorithms, the target variable is also called a label, class, or category, and the algorithm itself is called a classifier, recognizer, or categorizer. In the case of regression algorithms, the target variable is continuous or quantitative \(a real number\).
