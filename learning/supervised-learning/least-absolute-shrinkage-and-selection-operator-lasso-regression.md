**Lasso and ridge regression**

: This uses regularization to control overfitting issues by applying a penalty on coefficients. In ridge regression, a penalty is applied on the sum of squares of coefficients, whereas in lasso, a penalty is applied on the absolute values of the coefficients. The penalty can be tuned in order to change the dynamics of the model fit. Ridge regression tries to minimize the magnitude of coefficients, whereas lasso tries to eliminate them.
