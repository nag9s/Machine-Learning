CART was proposed by Leo Breiman to the machine learning community. Classically, this algorithm is known as **decision trees** only, but in the modern-day community, some programming languages refer to it as CART. This algorithm is the cornerstone of the ensemble machine learning system, like bagging and boosting.

The representation of CART is the binary tree only, and this is the same binary tree that we all have learned in data structures. Let's have a brief review of the binary tree algorithm.

Binary trees are different from other trees in the sense that in a normal tree structure, there may be any number of children for a parent node \(including root\); but in a binary tree, as its name suggests, any parent node can have a maximum of two branches \(or nodes\). This figure shows a representation of a simple binary tree:

This tree is a subtree that we created in the previous chapter. Here, you can see that each node has a maximum of two children. One more thing to add in hereâ€”when we work with numerical values as attribute values, our binary tree will look like this:
