The p-values are a decimals between 0 and 1 that represent the probability that the data given to us occurred by chance under the hypothesis test. S**imply put, the lower the p-value, the better the chance that we can reject the null hypothesis. For our purposes, the smaller the p-value, the better the chances that the feature has some relevance to our response variable and we should keep it.**
