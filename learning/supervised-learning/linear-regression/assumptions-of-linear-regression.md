Linear regression has the following assumptions, failing which the linear regression model does not hold true:

* The dependent variable should be a linear combination of independent variables
* No autocorrelation in error terms
* Errors should have zero mean and be normally distributed
* No or little multi-collinearity
* Error terms should be homoscedastic
