This is the scenario in which multiple decisions need to be taken by an agent prior to reaching the target and it provides a reward, either +1 or -1, rather than notifying how well or how badly the agent performed across the path:



Reinforcement learning is the problem of getting an agent to act in the world so as to maximize its rewards. It is about what to do and how to map situations to actions so as to maximize a numerical reward signal. The learner is not told which actions to take, as in

most forms of machine learning, but instead must discover which actions yield the most

reward by trying them. The two most important distinguishing features of reinforcement

learning are trial and error and search and delayed reward
