Supervised learning entails **learning a mapping between a set of input variables \(typically a  
 vector\) and an output variable \(also called the supervisory signal\) and applying this  
 mapping to predict the outputs for unseen data.  Supervised methods attempt to discover    
 **the relationship between input variables and target variables. The relationship discovered is  
 represented in a structure referred to as a model. Usually models describe and explain  
 phenomena, which are hidden in the dataset and can be used for predicting the value of the  
 target attribute knowing the values of the input attributes.

Supervised learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function from supervised

training data \(set of training examples\). The training data consists of a set of training

examples. In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object and a

desired output value. **A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and  
**

**produces an inferred function.**
