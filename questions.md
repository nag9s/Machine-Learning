**Why are there two different datasets and why do we need a separate dataset to test our model?**

This is because of the danger of overfitting, that is, fitting a model that is really good for the dataset it was estimated for, but underperforms when it is applied to new data.

**How do we select the best single model out of so many possible variants?**
