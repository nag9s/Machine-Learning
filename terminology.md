Machine learning also has some terminologies that are specific to its domain and it is worth discussing them:

* **Feature**
  : For any observation feature represents a set of traits that describes the entity quantitatively. For example, for a car the feature can be its color, car model, number of seats, and so on.
* **Label**
  : Label is a dependent entity whose outcome is related to the values of a feature. Such as in case of features of a car depending on the car model and number of seats and the label could be the maker of the car.

Input variables \(X\): Features, predictors, explanatory variables, independent

variables

Output variables \(Y\): Response variable, dependent variable
