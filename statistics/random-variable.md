**A random variable is a measure of a trait or value associated with an object, a person, or a place — something in the real world — that is unpredictable.** Because this trait or value is unpredictable, however, doesn’t mean you know nothing about it. What’s more, you can use what you do know about this thing to help you in your decision making.

To understand discrete and continuous distribution, consider the weight of fashion models.** A discrete variable would be the weight of one model,whereas a continuous variable would be a weight range that is acceptable for models in the fashion industry at large .**

Probability distribution is classified per these two types:

**Discrete: **A random variable where values can be counted by groupings

**Continuous:** A random variable that assigns probabilities to a range of value



**Discrete data** is composed of distinct numeric values.

**Continuous data** covers a range, where any value within that range is possible. It’s frequently data that is measured in some way, rather than counted.
