**A random variable is a measure of a trait or value associated with an object, a person, or a place — something in the real world — that is unpredictable.** Because this trait or value is unpredictable, however, doesn’t mean you know nothing about it. What’s more, you can use what you do know about this thing to help you in your decision making.

To understand discrete and continuous distribution, consider the weight of fashion models.** A discrete variable would be the weight of one model,whereas a continuous variable would be a weight range that is acceptable for models in the fashion industry at large .**
