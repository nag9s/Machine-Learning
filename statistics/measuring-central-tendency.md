Mean is represented with u \( MEW\)

Sometimes mean will be pulled or impacted by outliers -  An extreme high or low value that stands out from the rest of the data. When outliers “pull” the data to the left or right, it is called Skewed Data.

## Median

If the mean becomes misleading because of skewed data and outliers, then we need some other way of saying what a typical value is. We can do this by, quite literally, taking the middle value. This is a different sort of average, and it’s called the  median

. To find the median of the Kung Fu class, line up all the ages in ascending order, and then pick the middle value

If you have an even set of numbers, just take the  **mean of the two middle numbers**

\(add them together, and divide by 2\), and that’s your median.

## What is wrong with the mean and median? {#what_went_wrong_with_the_mean_and_median}

The mean and median for the class are both 17, even though there are no 17-year-olds in the class!

But what if there had been an odd number of people in the class. Both the mean and median would still have been misleading.
