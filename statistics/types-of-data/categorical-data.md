that has no inherent numeric meaning.![](/assets/cat.png)



So, for example, I can say that the area of Texas is greater than the area of Florida, but I can't just say Texas is greater than Florida, they're just categories. There's no real numerical quantifiable meaning to them, it's just ways that we categorize different things.
