 The other type of numerical data is continuous data, and this is stuff that has an infinite range of possibilities where you can go into fractions.

 So, for example, going back to the height of people, there is an infinite number of possible heights for people. You could be five feet and 10.37625 inches tall, or the time it takes to do something like check out on a website could be any huge range of possibilities, 10.7625 seconds for all you know, or how much rainfall in a given day. Again, there's an infinite amount of precision there. So that's an example of continuous data.
