The last category that you tend to hear about with types of data is ordinal data, and it's sort of a mixture of numerical and categorical data. A common example is star ratings for a movie or music, or what have you.![](/assets/ordi1.png)



we have categorical data in that could be 1 through 5 stars, where 1 might represent poor and 5 might represent excellent, but they do have mathematical meaning. We do know that 5 means it's better than a 1, so this is a case where we have data where the different categories have a numerical relationship to each other. So, I can say that 1 star is less than 5 stars, I can say that 2 stars is less than 3 stars, I can say that 4 stars is greater than 2 stars in terms of a measure of quality. Now you could also think of the actual number of stars as discrete numerical data. So, it's definitely a fine line between these categories, and in a lot of cases you can actually treat them interchangeably.

So, there you have it, the three different types. There is numerical, categorical, and ordinal data. Let's see if it's sunk in. Don't worry, I'm not going to make you hand in your work or anything.
