**Why Normal Distribution ?**

The normal distribution is important because of the [Central limit theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem)

.  In simple terms, if you have many independent variables that may be generated by all kinds of distributions, assuming that nothing too crazy happens, the aggregate of those variables will tend toward a normal distribution.  This universality across different domains makes the normal distribution one of the centerpieces of applied mathematics and statistics.

Another corollary is that the normal distribution makes math easy - things like calculating moments, correlations between variables, and other calculations that are domain specific.  For that reason, even if a distribution isn't actually normal, it is useful to assume that it is normal to get a good, first-order understanding of a set of data.
