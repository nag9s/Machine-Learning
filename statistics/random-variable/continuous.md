## Probability density functions can be used for continuous data {#probability_density_functions_can_be_use}

We can describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable using a probability density function. A probability density function f\(x\) is a function that you can use to find the probabilities of a continuous variable across a range of values. It tells us what the shape of the probability distribution is.

**aren’t probability density and probability the same thing?** Probability density gives you a means of _finding_

probability, but it’s not the probability itself. The probability density function is the line on the graph, and the probability is given by the area underneath it for a specific range of values.
