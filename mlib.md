MLlib is a scalable machine learning library built on top of Spark. The machine learning library is composed of two distinct packages, which are \[17:03\]:

1. `org.apache.spark.mllib`
   : RDD-based library of some common machine learning algorithms. This package** will be deprecated in future releases.**
2. `org.apache.spark.ml`
   : Library of machine learning algorithms that leverages datasets and data frames structures. The package supports tasks pipeline and stages that are described and illustrated in the next section.
