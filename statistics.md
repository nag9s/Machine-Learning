Statistics  are numbers that summarize raw facts and figures in some meaningful way. They present key ideas that may not be immediately apparent by just looking at the raw data, and by data, we mean facts or figures from which we can draw conclusions.

As an example, you don’t have to wade through lots of football scores when all you want to know is the league position of your favorite team. You need a statistic to quickly give you the information you need.
