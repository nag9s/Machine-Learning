Statistics  are numbers that summarize raw facts and figures in some meaningful way. They present key ideas that may not be immediately apparent by just looking at the raw data, and by data, we mean facts or figures from which we can draw conclusions.

As an example, you don’t have to wade through lots of football scores when all you want to know is the league position of your favorite team. You need a statistic to quickly give you the information you need.

## But why learn statistics? {#but_why_learn_statisticsquestion_mark}

Understanding **what’s really going on with statistics empowers you**. **If you really **_**get**_** statistics, you’ll be able to make objective decisions, make accurate predictions that seem inspired, and convey the message you want in the most effective way possible.**



**Stastics of Two Types.**

**Descriptive statistics**  - providing you with a **description that illuminates some characteristic of sample data or subset**



**Inferential Staistics** - inferential statistics provide information about a small data selection, so you can use this information to infer something about thelarger dataset from which it was taken .



Explain with an example for age 18 to 34 that live in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 

Descriptive statistics would allow you to understand the characteristics of the woman population that comprises this subset .

use inferential statistics  with this dataset to make inferences about the larger population of women, who are 18 to 34 years old,but that are living in all cities in the state of Pennsylvania \(and not just in Philadelphia\).
