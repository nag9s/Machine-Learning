Linear algebra

 is a branch of mathematics focusing on vector spaces and linear operations and mappings between them expressed mainly by matrices. 

Linear algebra is 

































essential for understanding the math behind most machine-learning algorithms, so if you donâ€™t know much about vectors and matrices
