Fundamental data types in this library are vectors and matrices. Vectors are local, and may be dense or sparse. Dense vectors are stored as an array of values. Sparse vectors are stored as two arrays; theÂ first array stores the non-zero value indices and the second array stores the actual values. All element values are stored as doubles and indices are stored as integers starting from zero. Understanding the fundamental structures goes a long way in effective use of the libraries and it should help code up any new algorithm from scratch. Let us see some example code for a better understanding of these two vector representations:
