A `CoordinatedMatrix` stores data as tuples of row, column indexes, and element value.  

elements values are explicit defined by using  IndexedRow\(row\_index, col\_index, value\).

CoordinateMatrix stores its values as an RDD of MatrixEntry objects, which contain individual entries and their \(i,j\) positions in the matrix. This isnâ€™t an efficient way of storing data, so you should use CoordinateMatrix only for storing sparse matrices. Otherwise, it could consume too much memory.
