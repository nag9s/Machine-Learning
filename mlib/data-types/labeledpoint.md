> There's also a LabeledPoint data type that comes up, and that's just what it sounds like, a point that has some sort of label associated with it that conveys the meaning of this data in human readable terms.

A dense or sparse local vector having a label or a response value is called a labeled point. They are used in supervised learning more prominently in classification and regression-based algorithms. Labeled point values are stored in a double datatype.
