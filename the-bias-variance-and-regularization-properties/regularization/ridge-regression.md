When the number of parameters is very large, particularly compared to the number of available observations, linear regression tends to exhibit very high variance. This is to say that small changes in a few of the observations will cause the coefficients to change substantially. **Ridge regression **is a method that introduces bias through its constraint but is effective at reducing the model's variance.
